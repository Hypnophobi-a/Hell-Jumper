# Todo List

- Make stamina actually go down when sprinting/regenerate over time
- Add black borders so you can't see beyond the maps edge
- Separate main.lua into different files so it's not so junk
- Allow players to create JSON files to add custom items
- Change config/settings to take input from a JSON file
